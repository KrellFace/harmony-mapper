# Harmony Mapper


System developed by Oliver Withington (owithington.com) and Sara Cardinal (saracardinalemusic.com) for generating emotionally diverse chord sequences using Neo-Riemannian theory.

Formed the basis of 'HarmonyMapper: Generating Emotionally Diverse Chord Progressions for Games', which will be presented at the Experimental Games Workshop 2023.
